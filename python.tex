\section{Example, Figure and Tables}
\vskip6pt
\begin{example}[Optional Example Name]
Use Black's law [Equation (6.3)] to estimate the reduction in useful product
life if a metal line is initially run at 55$^\circ$C at a maximum line
current density.
\end{example}




\begin{figure}[ht]
illustration here
%\centerline{\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{filename}}
\caption{Short figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\vskip2pt
\caption{Oscillograph for  memory address access operations,
showing 500 ps
address access time and superimposed signals
of address access in 1 kbit
memory plane.}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Small Table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
one&two&three&four\\
\hline
C&D&E&F\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Effects of the two types of $\alpha\beta\sum^A_B$ scaling proposed by Dennard \newline
and
co-workers$^{a,b}$}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcc}
\hline

\hline
Dimension&$\kappa^{-1}$&$\lambda^{-1}$\cr
Voltage&$\kappa^{-1}$&$\kappa^{-1}$\cr
Currant&$\kappa^{-1}$&$\lambda/\kappa^{2}$\cr

\hline
\end{tabular*}
\begin{tablenotes}
$^a$Refs.~19 and 20.

$^b\kappa, \lambda>1$.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

\subsection{Side by Side Tables and Figures}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\sidebyside{
Space for figure...
\caption{This caption will go on the left side of
the page. It is the initial caption of two side-by-side captions.}
}
{
Space for second figure...
\caption{This caption will go on the right side of
the page. It is the second of two side-by-side captions.}
}
\end{figure}


The command \verb+\sidebyside{}{}+ works similarly for tables:

 \begin{table}[ht]
 \sidebyside{
\caption{Table Caption} 
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
one&two&three&four\\
a &little&sample&table
\end{tabular}
}
 {
\caption{Table Caption}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
A&B&C&D\\
a &second little& sample&table
\end{tabular}
}
 \end{table}


When using \verb+\sidebyside+, one must
use the cross referencing command \verb+\label{}+ after and  {\it outside} 
 of \verb+\caption{}+:

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{table} 
 \sidebyside{\caption{Table Caption}\label{tab1}
 first table}
 {\caption{Table Caption}\label{tab2} second table}
 \end{table}
\end{verbatim}
 or,
\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{figure} 
 \sidebyside{\vskip<dimen>\caption{fig caption}\label{fig1}}
 {\vskip<dimen>\caption{fig caption}\label{fig2}}
 \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

{Python Multithread Programming}
\\}\end{center} \par
\vspace{14pt}
\vspace{14pt}
Menjalankan beberapa\textit{ thread} mirip dengan menjalankan beberapa program yang berbeda secara bersamaan, namun dengan manfaat berikut : \par
\begin{itemize}
\item Beberapa \textit{thread} dalam proses berbagi ruang data yang sama dengan benang induk dan karena dapat saling berbagi informasi atau berkomunikasi satu sama lain dengan lebih muda daripada jika prosesnya terpisah \par
\item \textit{thread} terkadang disebut proses ringan dan tidak membutuhkan banyak memori atas, mereka lebih murah daripada proses.\end{itemize}
\par
Sebuah \textit{thread} memiliki permulaan, urutan eksekusi dan sebuah kesimpulan. Ini memiliki pointer perintah yang melacak dari mana dalam konteksnya saat ini berjalan.  \par
\noindent 
\begin{itemize}
\item Hal ini dapat dilakukan sebelum pre-\textit{empted} (\textit{inturrepted}) \par
\noindent 
\item Untuk sementara dapat ditunda sementara \textit{thread} lainnya yang sedang berjalan ini disebut unggul. \end{itemize}
\par
\noindent 

\section{Memulai Thread Baru}
\\}\end{center \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Untuk melakukan \textit{thread} lain, perlu memanggil metode berikut yang tersedia dimodul \textit{thread} : \par
\noindent 
\begin{center}{\fontsize{9pt}{9pt}\selectfont Thread.start $  \_  $new $  \_  $thread (function, args [, kwargs] )}\end{center} \par
\vspace{12pt}
Pemanggilan metode ini memungkinkan cara cepat dan tepat untuk membuat \textit{thread} baru di linux dan window. \par
Pemanggilan metode segera kembali dan anak  \textit{thread} dimulai dan fungsi pemanggilan dengan daftar \textit{args} telah berlalu. Saat fungsi kembali ujung \textit{thread} akan berakhir.   \par
Disini, \textit{args }adalah tupel argumen. Gunakan tupel kosong untuk memanggil fungsi tanpa melewati argumen. \textit{Kwargs} adalah kamus opsional argumen kata kunci.  \par

\section{Modul Threading }
\\}\end{center} \par
Modul threading yang lebih baru disertakan dengan Python 2.4 memberikan jauh lebih kuat, dukungan tingkat tinggi untuk \textit{thread}\textit{ }dari modul\textit{ }\textit{thread}\textit{ }dibahas pada bagian sebelumnya. \par
The \textit{thread}\textit{ing }modul mengekpos semua metode dari \textit{thread}\textit{ }dan menyediakan beberapa metode tambahan : \par
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{t}\textbf{hreading.activeCount() } \par
	Mengembalikan jumlah objek \textit{thread} yang aktif \par
	\item \textbf{t}\textbf{hreading.currentThread() } \par
	Mengembalikan jumlah objek \textit{thread} dalam kontrol benang pemanggil \par
	\item \textbf{t}\textbf{hreading.enumerate() } \par
	Mengembalikan daftar semua benda \textit{thread}\textit{ }yang sedang aktif \par
	\vspace{12pt}
	Selain metode, modul \textit{thread}\textit{ing }memiliki \textit{thread}\textit{ }kelas yang mengimplementasikan \textit{thread}\textit{ing. }Metode yang disediakan oleh \textit{thread}\textit{ }kelas adalah sebagai berikut : \par
	\item \textbf{run()} \par
	Metode adalah titik masuk untuk \textit{thread} \par
	\item \textbf{start()} \par
	Metode dimulai\textbf{ }\textit{thread}\textit{ }dengan memanggil metode run \par
	\item \textbf{join(}\textbf{[time]}\textbf{)} \par
	Menunggu benang untuk mengakhiri \par
	\item \textbf{isAlive()} \par
	Metode memeriksa apakah\textbf{ }\textit{thread}\textit{ }masih mengeksekusi\textbf{ } \par
	\item \textbf{getName()} \par
	Metode mengambalikan nama\textbf{ }\textit{thread} \par
	\item \textbf{setName()} \par
	Metode menetapkan nama\textbf{ }\textit{thread} \par

\section{Membuat Thread Menggunakan Threading Modul}
\\}\end{center} \par
Untuk melaksanakan \textit{thread}\textit{ }baru menggunakan\textit{ threading} harus melakukan hal berikut : \par
\item \textbf Mendefinisikan subclass dari \textit{thread} kelas \par
\item Menimpa  $  \_  $init $  \_  $ (self [args]) metode untuk menambahkan argumen tambahan \par
\item Menimpa run(self[args]) metode untuk menerapkan apa \textit{thread} harus dilakukan ketika mulai \end{itemize}
\par
\begin{adjustwidth}
Setelah membuat baru \textit{thread} subclass, dapat membuah seuah instance dari itu dan kemudian memulai \textit{thread} baru dengan menerapkan \textit{start(),} yang ada gilirinnya panggilan \textit{run()} metode.\end{adjustwidth}

{T}\textit{hread}\textit{ing }modul disediakan dengan Python termasuk sederhana untuk menerapkan mekanisme bahwa memungkinkan untuk menyinkronkan \textit{thread}\textit{ }penguncian. Sebuah kunci baru dibuat dengan memanggil \textit{lock() }metode yang mengembalikan kunci baru. \par
The \textit{acquire}\textit{ }\textit{(blocking)}\textit{ }metode objek kunci baru digunakan untuk memaksa \textit{thread}\textit{ }untuk menjalankan serempak. Opsional \textit{blocking} parameter memungkikan untuk mengontrol apakah\textit{ thread} menunggu untuk mendapatkan kunci. \par
Jika \textit{blocking} diatur ke 0, \textit{thread} segera kembali dengan nilai 0 jika kunci tidak dapat diperoleh dan dengan 1 jika kunci dikuisisi. Jika pemblokiran diatur ke 1, blok dan menunggu kunci yang akan dirilis. \par
The \textit{release()} metode objek kunci baru digunakan untuk melepaskan kunci ketika tidak lagi diperlukan.  \par

\chapter{XML Processing}
XML adalah bahasa open source portable yang memungkinkan pemrogram mengemangkan aplikasi yang dapat dibaca oleh aplikasi lain, terlepas dari sistem operasi dan bahasa pengembangnya. \par
\vspace{12pt}
\noindent 
Apa itu XML? \par
Extensible Markup Languange (XML) adalah bahasa markup seperti HTML atau SGML. Ini direkomendasikan oleh World Wide Web Consortium dan tersedia sebagai standar terbuka.  \par
XML sangat berguna untuk mencatat data berukuran kecil dan menengah tanpa memerlukan tulang punggung berbasis SQL. \par
\vspace{12pt}
\noindent 

\section{Arsitektur Parsing XML dan API}
 \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Perpustakaan standar Python menyediakan seperangkat antarmuka minimal tapi berguna untuk bekerja dengan XML.  \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Dua API yang paling dasar dan umum digunakan untuk data XML adalah antarmuka SAX dan DOM. \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} API sederhana untuk XML (SAX): mendaftarkan panggilan kemali untuk acara yang diminati dan kemudian membiarkan parser berjalan melalui dokumen. Ini berguna bila dokumen berukuran besar atau memiliki keterbatasan memori, ini memparsing file tidak pernah tersimpan dalam memori. \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} API Document Objek Model (DOM): ini adalah rekomendasi World Wide Web Consortium dimana keseluruhan file dibaca ke memori dan disimpan dalam bentuk hierarkies (tree-based) untuk mewakili semua fitur dokumen XML.  \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} SAX jelas tidak bisa memproses informasi secepat DOM saat bisa bekerjadengan file besar. Di sisi lain, menggunakan DOM secara eklusifenar-benar dapat membunuh sumber daya, terutama jika digunakan pada banyak file kecil. \par
\noindent 
~~~~~~~~~~~ SAX hanya bisa dibaca sementara DOM mengizinkan perubahan pada file XML. Kedua API yang berbeda ini saling melengkapi satu sama lain, tidak ada alasan mengapa tidak dapat menggunakannya untuk proyek besar. \par

\section{Parsing XML dan API SAX}
\par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} SAX adalah antarmuka standar untuk parsing XML berbasis event. Parsing XML dengan SAX umumnya mengharuskan untuk membuat C\textit{ontrolHandler }dengan subclassing xml.sax \textit{controlhandler}. \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} \textit{ControlHandler }menangani tag dan atribut tertentu dari XML. Objek \textit{ControlHandler }menyediakan metode untuk menangani berbagai aktivitas parsing. Parsing memanggil metode \textit{ControlHandler }saat memparsing file XML. \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Metode \textit{startDocument} dan \textit{endDocument} disebut awal dan akhir setiap elemen. Jika parsing tidak dalam mode namespace, metode \textit{startElement} (tag attribute) dan \textit{endElement} (tag) dipanggil. Jika tidak, metode yang sesuai \textit{startElemenNS} dan \textit{endElemenNS} dipanggil. Disini, tah adalah tag elemen dan atriut adalah atribut.  \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Berikut ini metode penting untuk memahami sebelum melanjutkan ke materi berikutnya : \par
\noindent 
\begin{myEnumerate}
	\item Metode \textit{make $  \_  $parser} \par

	Parser $  \_  $list : pilihan argumen yang terdiri dari daftar parsing untuk digunakan yang semuanya harus menerapkan metode \textit{make $  \_  $parse} \par
	\noindent 
	\item Metode \textit{parser} \par
	Metode berikut membuat parsing SAX dan menggunakannya untuk mengurai dokumen \par
	\vspace{10pt}
	{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont xml.sax.parser(xmlfile, contenthandler[, errorhandler])} \par
	\vspace{10pt}
	Berikut adalah detail dari parameternya: \par
	\noindent 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Xmlfile } \par
		Ini adalah nama file XML yang bisa dibaca. \par
		\noindent 
		\item \textit{ContentHandler } \par
		Ini harus menjadi objek \textit{ContenHandler} \par
		\noindent 
		\item \textit{ErrorHandler} \par
		Jika ditentukan, e\textit{rrorhandler} harus menjadi objek \textit{ErrorHandler} SAX \par
		\noindent 
		\item Metode\textit{ parseString}\end{itemize}
	\par

\section{Parsing XML dan API DOM}
\par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Document Ovject Model (DOM) adalah API lintas bahasa dari World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) untuk mengakses dan memodifikasi dokumen XML. \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} DOM sangat berguna untuk aplikasi akses acak. SAX hanya memungkinkan melihat satu bit dokumen sekaligus. Jika melihat satu elemen SAX, tidak memiliki akses ke yang lain. \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Berikut adalah cara termudah untuk memuat dokumen XML dengan cepat dan membuat objek minidom menggunakan modul xml.dom. Objek minidom menyediakan metode parsing sederhana yang dengan cepat memuat pohon DOM dari file XML. \par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Contoh~frase memanggil fungsi  parsing (file [,parsing]) dari objek minidokumen untuk mengurai file XML yang ditunjuk oleh file ke objek pohon DOM. \par

\section{Membangun Parsing Document XML menggunakan Python}
\par
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Python mendukung untuk bekerja dengan berbagai bentuk markup data terstruktur. Selain mengurai xml.etree. \textit{ElementTree} mendukung pembuatan dokumen XML yang terbentuk dengan baik dari objek elemen yang dibangun dalam aplikasi. Kelas elemen digunakakan saat sebuah dokumen diurai untuk mengetahui bagaimana menghasilkan bentuk serial dari isinya kemudian dapat ditulis ke sebuah file.  \par
\vspace{12pt}
\noindent 
\hspace*{0.5in} Untuk membuat instance elemeb gunakan fungsi elemen contructor dan \textit{SubElemen()} pabrik. \par
\noindent 
Import xml.etree.ElementTree as xml \par
\vspace{12pt}
\noindent 
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont filename =  $ " $/home/abc/Desktop/test $  \_  $xml.xml $ " $} \par

{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont userelement = xml.Element( $ " $user $ " $)} \par
\noindent 
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont root.append(userelement)} \par
\noindent 
\vspace{10pt}

\appendix{}
This is an appendix without a title.

Here is a math test to show the difference between using Computer Modern
math fonts and MathTimes math fonts. When MathTimes math fonts are used
the letters in an equation will match TimesRoman italic in the text.
({\it g, i, y, x, P, F, n, f, etc.}) Caligraphic fonts, used for
$\cal ABC$ below, will stay the same
in either case.
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x){\cal ABC}
\end{equation}
where $g_i(y|F_n)$ is the function specifying the probability an object will
display a value $y$ on a dimension $i$ given $F_n$ the observed feature
structure of all the objects.
